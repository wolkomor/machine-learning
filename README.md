# project in machine learning
This project was done as part of data mining course in Tel-Aviv University. 
This project deals with a binary classification problem. For classification problems, the prediction given as an answer to this question is one (or more) of a closed set of possible answers. The classification problem in the project is a binary classification problem in which products should be classified into two categories based on a number of features in the dataset that comes from the German company Otto Group.
The process of data mining includes the following steps:
  1. Investigation of the data.
  2. Data processing.
  3. Creating and selecting features.
  4. Modeling.

In the modeling phase,  I compare the following models:
  1. Gaussian
  2. KNN
  3. Logistic regression
  4. Neural networks
  5. Decision Tree
  
I Choose the model that will yield the highest value of AUC on the validation set.
